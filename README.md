## <a name="features">ü§ñ How It Works</a>
- **Sign in with Wallet Connect (using Metamask, WalletConnect or Coinbase Wallet)**
![Untitled design](https://i.ibb.co/7rGw6NW/Screenshot-2024-10-12-at-17-41-28.png)


Filefusion has three modes.
- **Storage Mode** - The storage mode works like a basic version of dropbox. Users can upload files and get a shareable link to access their uploaded files

- **Transfer Mode** - Transfer mode functions as a web3 version of Wetransfer. Files are uploaded and transfered to recipient's email
<img width="1439" alt="transfer-mode" src="https://github.com/Ghost-xDD/FileFusion/assets/42726051/51cfc2b3-f90a-4e9e-b79b-b9e09ad39106">

- **Private Mode** - Files transferred using private mode are encrypted before they are uploaded and transferred to the recipient. User's get access to a decryption site in their email and only the wallet address with the designated NFT Key can access the file.

#### Wallet Connect Project ID

Note: Every dApp that relies on WalletConnect now needs to obtain a projectId (NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID) from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). This is absolutely free and only takes a few minutes.
Once you get the Project ID from WalletConnect Cloud, you can set it as an environment variable in your project.

#### Iron Session Password
Iron Session will encrypt the session with the given secret key (NEXT_IRON_PASSWORD)
You can generate a secret key using this code on your terminal
`openssl rand -hex 32` or go to https://generate-secret.now.sh/32


#### Environment Variables
- ```NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=```
- ```APILLON_COMPUTING_CONTRACT_UUID=```
- ```APILLON_BUCKET_UUID=```
- ```APILLON_API_KEY=```
- ```APILLON_API_SECRET=```
- ```EMAIL_USER=```
- ```EMAIL_PASS=```
- ```EMAIL_HOST=```
- ```NEXT_IRON_PASSWORD=```
